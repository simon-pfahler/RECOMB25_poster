# Exploiting weak modularity in cancer progression to infer large Mutual Hazard Networks

This repository stores everything needed to recreate the RECOMB25 poster "Exploiting weak modularity in cancer progression to infer large Mutual Hazard Networks" by S. Pfahler, L. Ernstberger et. al.

The repository consists of the following parts:
- `data`: folder containing all results presented on the poster, along with the scripts that generated the results
    - `biological`: results for a dataset using MSK-CHORD data of 5907 LUADs, trained on 125 genetic events
    - `validation`: results shown in the box titled "Validation", along with a simple script `clustering_example.py` that was used to generate the data visualizing the example clustering process on the right side of the poster
- `latex`: LaTeX code for the poster
- `latex_presentation`: LaTeX code for the slides accompanying the lightning talk
